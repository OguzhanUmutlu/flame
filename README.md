# 🔥 Flame

> **What if you combined the best features of Rust, C++, Go, and Kotlin into a single programming language?**

**Flame** is the answer.
A modern systems programming language that brings together the **performance of C++**, the **safety of Rust**, the **simplicity and concurrency of Go**, and the **expressiveness of Kotlin**; all in one cohesive design.

---

## ✨ Key Philosophy

* **Speed** - Compiles down to blazing-fast native binaries.
* **Safety** - Memory-safe by design, without garbage collection pauses.
* **Simplicity** - Clean syntax that stays out of your way.
* **Concurrency** - Lightweight, Go-style parallelism built into the core.
* **Interoperability** - Seamlessly interface with C/C++ and system APIs.
* **Expressiveness** - Modern language constructs inspired by Kotlin.

## 🚀 Why Flame?

Flame isn’t about reinventing the wheel, it’s about **reforging** it.
By learning from the strengths and pitfalls of the giants before it, Flame aims to deliver:

* The **control and speed** of C++
* The **guarantees** of Rust
* The **developer joy** of Go
* The **expressive elegance** of Kotlin

All in a single, cohesive language.

```flame
fun main() {
    for (val i in 1:1000000) {
        println("Hello, Flame! ", i)
    }
}
```

Simple. Safe. Fast.
